# GitHub Codespaces Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and use GitHub Codespaces for this Java programming course.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account

## Getting the Repository in Your Account

To work on this course repository, you need to create your own copy (fork) of the repository:

1. Go to the course repository: [COMP-2230-02](https://github.com/ShivaniTyagiCS2026/COMP-2230-02)
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination
4. Wait for the fork to complete

This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account that you can modify freely.

## Setting Up Codespaces

1. Navigate to **your forked repository** on GitHub (it will be at `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/COMP-2230-02`)
2. Click the **"Code"** button
3. Select **"Open with Codespaces"**
4. Choose **"New codespace"**

## Environment Configuration
